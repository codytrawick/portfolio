Porftolio Front End Application

Built with Vite + React from Create Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

<!-- ## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation). -->
